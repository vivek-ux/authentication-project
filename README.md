# authentication-project

This is an authentication project built with technologies like HTML,CSS,Bootstrap in the frontened and node.js(express framework) in the backend ;
The database used here is the postgreSql database .
With this project you can sign up a user , an otp will be send to their email id, the same will happen during password reset;
The project is built using the code and fix software development lifecycle model(SDLC) so any changes to optimize this project further will be highly appreciated .
Thanks.
